# Twitter-Incognito
a simple twitter script that soft blocks all followers that you do not follow back 
# If you're looking for a download link to just use the script here it is: [Download](https://mohanedattef.github.io/Twitter-Incognito/incognito.exe)  
It'll open a link and once you authorize it you provide the script with the pin, if later i turn this into a web application this step won't be needed.  
also I know the list of authoraizations you need to provide is a lot but this is the level of authorization that needs to happen to block someone.  
# Requirements 
You'll need nothing to excute the downloadable script above but if you wanna tinker with the code you'll obviously need twitter api credentials that you'll add in the **.env** file and you'll also need to have the **tweepy** library installed, the rest of the imports come with python.
